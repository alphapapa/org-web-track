Org Web Track
*************

‘org-web-track’ is an Elisp package for org-mode that provides commands
and functions to assist users in keeping track of data snippets from web
pages that may change over time, such as scores, prices, or states.

  1. tracking support org-web-track retrieves data based on a
     user-defined URL and selector, which indicate where to access and
     from which location to gather the data, respectively.  Once they
     are set appropriately, org-web-track looks up on demand and updates
     the value.

  2. comprehensible data display In the context of org-web-track, an org
     entry with a URL is considered a tracking item.  org-web-track
     offers a specialized column view for reviewing a group of tracking
     items, including their current values and updated time.

  3. data log utilization org-web-track logs all updates and provides a
     command to create an org table that shows data transitions in
     ascending order of time.  Users can utilize the table in various
     ways, including for data analysis and visualization.

   ‘org-web-track’ is currently under development.  Use it at your own
risk.

Basic data tracking workflow
============================

  1. Setup selectors

     The variable ‘org-web-track-selector-alist’ is used to define a
     list of selection conditions in the (URL-MATCH .  SELECTOR) format.
     If a tracking item has a URL that matches URL-MATCH, the SELECTOR
     is applied to the response for that URL to capture data.

     SELECTOR can take on one of three forms: a vector, a function, or a
     string.  If a vector is provided, it should represent a CSS
     selector.  If a function is provided, it will be called with a
     temporary buffer containing the HTML document.  If a string is
     provided, it should represent a shell command that will be invoked
     with the HTML string piped in.
  2. Creating tracking items

     To track an item in ‘org-web-track’, the user needs to create an
     org entry first and then use ‘org-web-track-setup’ to set a
     tracking URL and carry out initial data tracking.
  3. Updating data

     Users can update a specific org entry by invoking
     ‘org-web-track-update’.  If any updates are detected,
     ‘org-web-track’ logs a new record with the updated data and a
     timestamp.  Alternatively, users can update all tracking items in
     ‘org-web-track-files’ by calling ‘org-web-track-update-all’.
